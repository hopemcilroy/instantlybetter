             <h2>About the Author</h2>
             
             
              <img src="img/bandwhope.JPG" alt="author">
             <p>Hi there, I am Hope McIlroy, an Interaction Design Student <a href="http://ixdbelfast.org/">@ixdbelfast</a> and the author behind Instantly Better. I have a passion for photography and more so over the past year or two, specifically instant photography. So when we were briefed to create a digital product, I knew instant photography had to play a part in it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After recently receiving a Polaroid Originals One Step 2 Camera as a birthday gift, I started to explore the world of instant photography a little deeper. I am a sucker for capturing memories, which there is nothing wrong with, but the habit of taking 10 snaps of the exact same picture, is where the issue lay. Not only did it take up memory on my phone, but there was no need.
                <br>
                <br>
                 The essence of instant photography helped me to learn to take one considered snap and appreciate what I had taken, even if it wasn't perfect. At the end of the day it's the memories behind the snap that matters. I advise to pop the kettle on and enjoy the read.
